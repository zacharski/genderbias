As a Peritoneal Dialysis Registered Nurse (PD RN), you educate your patients on how to do their own dialysis from their homes, and you take responsibility for the complete ongoing care of each patient to ensure their treatment stays on track. You will work a Monday to Friday schedule-yet your impact on the lives of our patients will be felt every day.

If you haven’t considered Nephrology nursing before, read on as we think that you should. Dialysis Experience is NOT required.

What You Can Expect
Complexities - You multitask in myriad ways - put down one patient's chart, start another, work with a physician, run out to get a medication, respond to a supplier's request - with lots of loose ends to pull together and a lot of follow up. It's challenging, fun and keeps your day fresh.
Educator - Empower your patients by teaching them to administer their own dialysis and to take their health back into their own hands. If you feel your calling has always been to be both a nurse and educator, then you will love your work as a home hemodialysis registered nurse. Training patients takes time and mental energy and the rewards of that investment come in seeing the transformation of your patients from feeling sick and afraid, to strong and independent.
Autonomy - Provide comprehensive patient care in an independent setting. Plan to be on your toes at all times. You use your mind constantly. You apply your "core" nursing skills to assess, diagnose and implement complete care plans as you look at the whole patient. There's a lot to track and manage and the joy comes in witnessing how your care impacts patients' lives.

Oak Street Health is an innovative network of neighborhood primary care centers in the Midwest.

Annual wellness visits and health risk assessments, which require a holistic view of health and a focus on thoughtful, accurate, and specific documentation.
Care coordination with other providers, specialists, testing facilities, agencies.

Phone triage and outreach.
Patient education.
Oak Street Health promotional activities.
Other duties as assigned.

What we’re looking for

Nurse practitioners with experience in primary care: internal medicine, geriatrics, or family medicine.

Embrace teamwork and the opportunity to collaborate with brilliant colleagues.
Want to be a part of an innovative model focused on empirically-guided population health.
Spanish language skills preferred, depending on clinic location.
Experience in senior living, assisted living, or nursing facilities is preferred.
