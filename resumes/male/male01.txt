Technical Knowledge
Programming Languages, Platforms, Software
I have over fifteen years of experience with the Java programming language. Much of my recent
experience has focused on developing web services applications with Spring Boot, as well as
SDK-level work with such Amazon Web Services products such as DynamoDB, Aurora, SQS and
S3. These projects are typically built using the Gradle build tool, made into Docker images, and
deployed on a Kubernetes cluster.
I’m well versed in implementing industry leading two-factor authentication products such as RSA,
Adaptive Authentication, RSA SecurID, Authentify 2FA, and TeleSign PhoneID/Verify/TeleBureau. I
have experience with Remote Access devices including NetMotion Mobility Server, Citrix NetScaler
and F5 Networks BIG-IP Access Policy Manager.
The below demonstrates a portion of my track record in delivering value to both the
customer-facing and technical stages of engagement with government, Fortune 100 companies,
and startups.
Experience
2015 - Present​ : ​ Lead Software Engineer ​ , ​ Under Armour Connected Fitness

Designed and implemented the Spring-Boot based service used for both authentication and
storage of end-user data throughout Under Armour Connected Fitness. This system stores
data for 180M+ users and performs millions of user authentications daily.
Designed company-wide system to store user GDPR, EULA, and Targeted Ad Consent
data. Adapted the above user data service to store and audit this data; this enabled
continued ad revenue stream for the European market.
Continually refactored, updated and future-proofed the above service, accomplished
through three major upgrades of Spring Boot and three JDK versions. This increased
performance by 20% over baseline and allowed a 50% decrease in provisioned DynamoDB
read and write capacity.
Migrated this (and other services) to Kubernetes. This effort reduced the EC2 portion of the
organization’s Amazon Web Services bill by approximately 30%.
Implemented Opentracing (via Lightstep) for Spring Boot apps throughout the organization.
This typically reduced time-to-resolution for incidents by 75%.
Served as subject matter expert for DynamoDB within the organization. In doing so I gave
tech talks and assisted other teams in their designs.
Designed and implemented the API interface for an asynchronously-triggered function
platform. This project used Apache Kafka, Apache Avro, Scala and Akka.2013 - 2015​ : ​ Advisory Software Engineer , ​ ​ Lighthouse Computer Services / IBM

Leveraged the Spring-Social Java framework to bring social media based sign-in to a major
auto manufacturer’s online presence
Responsible for enhancements to the customer-facing REST API for user/group/service
management within the Gateway product
Developed software which allowed Tivoli Directory Integrator to transform and synchronize
data between Microsoft Active Directory and IBM Tivoli Directory Server
Implemented a fast Spring-OAuth2 token repository using Redis and the Jedis client library.
Used server-side LUA scripting to make all operations atomic.

Created custom email, phone and SMS-based second-factor authentication solutions for
America’s largest single health care provider. This solution protects the personal data of
1,000,000+ users across multiple business units.
Created a 2FA plug-in for RSA Adaptive Authentication using TeleSign’s PhoneID product.
This resulted in saving customers between $10,000 - $1,000,000 per year depending on
authentication request volume.
Enhanced customer and employee security for the world’s largest auto manufacturer by
guiding the replacement of a 3,000,000-seat in-house 2FA solution with RSA Adaptive
Authentication. Accommodated this customer’s unique needs by implementing source-level
changes to RSA software.
Created the official F5/RSA integration software between F5 Networks’ BIG-IP Access
Policy Manager and RSA Adaptive Authentication. This solution currently protects
America’s top management consultancy, the world’s largest alternative investment firm, and
the largest pediatric hospital in the United States.
Created mission-critical two-factor authentication solutions. These solutions gate all remote
access for a county government’s users, as well as their life-services vehicles which
included police cars, ambulances, and fire trucks.

Implemented software deployment packages, associated automation scripts, and
deployment tools utilized by product offerings for the IBM ITSM/CCMDB product
Authored the documentation and best practices used by all implementors of CCMDB
installable packages, which reduced time-to-value across product offerings that leveraged
the package technology. Provided cross-product support to software engineers working
with Tivoli’s installable package technology. This resulted in an 85% rate of same-day
resolution of open questions and issues.
Delivered four major releases of the IBM ITSM/CCMDB product. Resolved 40% of all
software defects assigned to the entire install team, and implemented 50% of all feature
requests. Rewrote the build infrastructure for the IBM ITSM/CCMDB product. This
increased build success rates from 60% to 95% while decreasing product build times over
80% and increasing build verification test success rates from 65% to 85%​ .2004​ : ​ Extreme Blue Technical Intern ​ , ​ IBM Almaden Research Center
